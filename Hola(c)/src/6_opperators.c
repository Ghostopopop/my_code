-----Arithmetic Operators
Operator	Meaning of Operator

+	addition or unary plus
-	subtraction or unary minus
*	multiplication
/	division
%	remainder after division (modulo division)

-------C Increment and Decrement Operators
C programming has two operators increment ++ and decrement -- to change the value of an operand (constant or variable) by 1.

Increment ++ increases the value by 1 whereas decrement -- decreases the value by 1.
 These two operators are unary operators, meaning they only operate on a single operand.

--------C Assignment Operators
An assignment operator is used for assigning a value to a variable. The most common assignment operator is =

Operator  Example       	Same as
=	       a = b	         a = b
+=	       a += b	         a = a+b
-=	       a -= b	         a = a-b
*=	       a *= b	         a = a*b
/=	       a /= b	         a = a/b
%=	       a %= b	         a = a%b

------C Relational Operators

Operator	                    Meaning of Operator	Example
==	Equal to	                  5 == 3 is evaluated to 0
>	Greater than	              5 > 3 is evaluated to 1
<	Less than	                  5 < 3 is evaluated to 0
!=	Not equal to	              5 != 3 is evaluated to 1
>=	Greater than or equal to	  5 >= 3 is evaluated to 1
<=	Less than or equal to	      5 <= 3 is evaluated to 0

------C Logical Operators
&&	Logical AND. True only if all operands are true
If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) && (d>5)) equals to 0.

||	Logical OR. True only if either one operand is true	
If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) || (d>5)) equals to 1.

!	Logical NOT. True only if the operand is 0	
If c = 5 then, expression !(c==5) equals to 0.


-----C Bitwise Operators
Operators	             Meaning of operators
&	                    Bitwise AND
|	                    Bitwise OR
^	                    Bitwise exclusive OR
~	                    Bitwise complement
<<	                    Shift left
>>	                    Shift right

The sizeof operator

The sizeof is a unary operator that returns the 
size of data (constants, variables, array, structure, etc). */
